IT IS BETTER TO USE DENSE_RANK() AND THEN FILTER BY RANK=1 BUT MY SOLUTION WITH IT HAD NOT BEEN ACCEPTED, SO HERE IS THE HARD WAY:

Solution:
select w.id, t1.age, t1.mi, t1.ma
from (
select code, age, min(coins_needed) mi, ma
from (
select w.code, wp.age, w.coins_needed, max(w.power) as ma
from wands w
join wands_property wp using(code)
where is_evil=0
group by code, age, coins_needed
) t
group by code, age, ma
) t1
join wands w on t1.code=w.code and t1.ma = w.power and t1.mi=w.coins_needed
order by ma desc, age desc
