THE SOLUTION FOR ADDDITIONAL CHALLENGE TO CREATE QUERY WITHOUT JOINS!
UGLY ONE BUT WORKS LIKE A CHARM!

Solution:
select sd, ed
from (
select sd, ed, ed-sd sub
from (
select *, if(p='Project' and lag(p) over (order by start_date)='Project' or p='Another Project' and lag(p) over (order by start_date)='Another Project', lag(start_date) over (order by start_date), start_date) sd, if(p='Project' and lead(p) over (order by start_date)='Project' or p='Another Project' and lead(p) over (order by start_date)='Another Project', lead(end_date) over (order by start_date), end_date) ed
from (
select *
from
(
select *, if(lag(p) over (order by start_date)!='Project' and p='Project' or p='No' or lag(p) over (order by start_date) is null and p='Project' or lag(p) over (order by start_date)!='Another Project' and p='Another Project', 'Y', 'N') yn, if(lead(p) over (order by start_date)!='Project' and p='Project' or p='No' or lead(p) over (order by start_date) is null and p='Project' or lead(p) over (order by start_date)!='Another Project' and p='Another Project', 'O', 'X') ox
